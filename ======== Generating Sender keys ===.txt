Your eyes are like clouds for even when they fill with sorrow and drown the land, they paint the sky with unimaginable beauty

They talk about how beautiful those flowers are , but they haven't seen the flowers that bloom inside my head every time i catchh a glimpse of yours

If i were to kiss you and go to hell i would. So then i can brag the devil's that i saw heaven without even entering it
